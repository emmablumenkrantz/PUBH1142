    " * A spreadsheet is a computer program that allows users to organize data in rows and columns, often used for calculations and small datasets. A database, on the other hand, is a structured set of data managed by a Database Management System (DBMS) and is designed to handle larger and more complex datasets with relationships between data elements.</span>\n",

    "2. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a spreadsheet for health data management?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:black;\">\n",
    "* Advantages: User-friendly interface, easy to learn and use, suitable for small datasets, allows for quick calculations and basic data analysis.\n",
    "* Disadvantages: Limited data capacity, not ideal for large or complex datasets, limited data integrity controls, and basic security measures.</span>\n",

    "3. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a database for health data management?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:black;\">\n",
    "* Advantages: Can handle large and complex datasets, maintains data integrity, supports relationships between data, allows multiple users to access data simultaneously, and offers advanced security measures.\n",
    "* Disadvantages: Requires knowledge of database design and SQL, more complex to set up and manage compared to spreadsheets.</span>\n",

    "4. **What are some examples of tasks that can be performed using a spreadsheet?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:black;\">\n",
    "* Financial analysis, budgeting, project management, data analysis, and record keeping.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What are some examples of tasks that can be performed using a database?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:black;\">\n",
    "* Managing patient records, storing large datasets, complex querying and reporting, and maintaining data integrity across multiple tables.</span>\n",

    "6. **What are some examples of tasks that can be performed using both a spreadsheet and a database?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:black;\">\n",
    "* Data entry, basic data analysis, and generating reports.</span>\n",

    "7. **What are some examples of tasks that can be performed using neither a spreadsheet nor a database?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:black;\">\n",
    "* Tasks that require real-time data processing or advanced machine learning models, such as real-time patient monitoring or predictive analytics.</span>\n",
